# Phase 3 Completion Summary: CBOR Pattern Captures Integration

## 🎯 Mission Accomplished

**Full support for named captures in `bc-envelope-pattern` CBOR patterns has been successfully implemented and integrated.** The `dcbor-pattern` capture system is now seamlessly accessible through the bc-envelope-pattern API.

## ✅ Completed Deliverables

### 1. Core Implementation
- **CBORPattern capture conversion**: Implemented complete conversion logic from dcbor captures to envelope captures
- **VM capture propagation**: Added `atomic_paths_with_captures` function to properly merge captures from leaf patterns
- **Compile-time registration**: CBOR patterns now register their capture names during compilation
- **Helper functions**: Created robust path conversion utilities for dcbor-to-envelope path transformation

### 2. API Integration
- **Public API support**: `Pattern::cbor_pattern()` now returns captures in addition to matches
- **Seamless mixing**: Envelope-level and CBOR-level captures work together without conflicts
- **Backwards compatibility**: All existing functionality continues to work unchanged

### 3. Test Coverage
- **10 comprehensive tests** in `tests/test_cbor_captures.rs` covering:
  - Simple dcbor captures: `CBOR(/@num(NUMBER(42))/)`
  - Search pattern captures: `CBOR(/@values(SEARCH(NUMBER))/)`
  - Nested structure captures: `CBOR(/@users(SEARCH(ARRAY(@name(TEXT) > @score(TEXT))))/)`
  - Mixed envelope + dcbor captures
  - Capture name conflict handling
  - Array traversal captures
  - Performance testing with large datasets
  - Edge cases (no matches, complex nesting)

### 4. Working Example Patterns

All of these now work correctly and return named captures:

```rust
// Simple capture
CBOR(/@name(NUMBER(42))/)

// Search captures
CBOR(/@values(SEARCH(NUMBER))/)

// Nested captures
CBOR(/@users(SEARCH(ARRAY(@name(TEXT) > @score(TEXT))))/)

// Mixed envelope + CBOR captures
@wrapper(CBOR(/@content(TEXT)/))
```

## 🏆 Success Metrics

- ✅ **All 10 CBOR capture tests pass**
- ✅ **All existing tests continue to pass** (no regressions)
- ✅ **Public API works**: `pattern.paths_with_captures()` returns CBOR captures
- ✅ **Complex patterns work**: Nested captures, search patterns, mixed envelope/CBOR captures
- ✅ **No name conflicts**: Envelope and CBOR capture names coexist peacefully
- ✅ **Clean code**: Passes `cargo clippy` with no warnings
- ✅ **Performance**: Minimal overhead, captures are opt-in

## 🛠 Technical Architecture

### Capture Flow
1. **CBOR patterns** with captures (e.g., `@name(TEXT)`) are parsed by dcbor-pattern
2. **CBORPattern::paths_with_captures()** calls dcbor-pattern's `paths_with_captures()`
3. **Path conversion** transforms dcbor paths (Vec<CBOR>) to envelope paths (Vec<Envelope>)
4. **VM integration** merges captures from atomic patterns via `atomic_paths_with_captures()`
5. **Public API** returns combined envelope + CBOR captures to user

### Key Files Modified
- `src/pattern/leaf/cbor_pattern.rs` - Core capture conversion logic
- `src/pattern/vm.rs` - VM capture propagation via `atomic_paths_with_captures`
- `src/pattern/leaf/leaf_pattern.rs` - Delegate captures to leaf implementations
- `src/pattern/meta/meta_pattern.rs` - Propagate captures through meta patterns
- `src/pattern/structure/structure_pattern.rs` - Propagate captures through structure patterns
- `tests/test_cbor_captures.rs` - Comprehensive test suite

## 🚀 Impact

This integration provides:

1. **Unified capture system**: `@name(pattern)` syntax works seamlessly across both envelope structure and CBOR content
2. **Enhanced expressiveness**: Complex capture patterns like search, nested captures, and mixed-level captures are now possible
3. **Consistent API**: All capture patterns return envelope paths, maintaining API consistency
4. **Zero breaking changes**: Existing code continues to work; captures are purely additive

## 📝 Usage Example

```rust
use bc_envelope::Envelope;
use bc_envelope_pattern::{Pattern, Matcher};
use dcbor_pattern::Pattern as DcborPattern;

// Create a CBOR pattern with named captures
let dcbor_pattern = DcborPattern::parse("@number(NUMBER(42))").unwrap();
let pattern = Pattern::cbor_pattern(dcbor_pattern);

// Execute and get both paths and captures
let envelope = Envelope::new(42);
let (paths, captures) = pattern.paths_with_captures(&envelope);

// captures["number"] now contains the captured number value
assert_eq!(captures.len(), 1);
assert_eq!(captures["number"].len(), 1);
```

## 🎉 Conclusion

**Phase 3 is complete and fully functional.** The bc-envelope-pattern crate now provides comprehensive CBOR pattern capture support by seamlessly integrating with dcbor-pattern's mature capture system. This enhancement significantly expands the pattern matching capabilities while maintaining full backwards compatibility and following established architectural patterns.

The implementation successfully bridges the architectural difference between bc-envelope-pattern's wrapper-based capture system and dcbor-pattern's individual pattern capture system, providing users with a unified and powerful pattern matching experience.
